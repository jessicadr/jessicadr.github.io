							<h1><a>CANVAS</a></h1>
							<h1>How might we help students keep track of their courses in a simple and intuitive way?</h1>
							<span class="image"><img class="canvasimg1" src="images/canvas_img1.png" alt="Canvas" /></span>
							<p><br>Canvas is UBC’s main academic platform where students, professors and teaching assistants can share assignments, discussions, announcements and grades with students as well as communicate over a messaging feature. </p>
							<h2>GOAL</h2>
							<p>Redesign the Canvas phone app to make its features more intuitive and useful to UBC students.</p>
							<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
								<h3>USABILITY TESTING:</h3>
								<p>First, we conducted a pre-screen questionnaire to obtain some background info from our participants.<br>
									We then conducted 2 task scenarios to identify the pain-points and potential improvements that could be made for the Canvas app. These tests were completed in person, and applied the think-aloud procedure.<br>
									Lastly, we asked 5 follow-up questions to expand more upon which specific features of the Canvas app work well for students, and if not, why. </p>
							<h2>DEMOGRAPHICS</h2>
								<p>We tested <b>20 students</b> from <b>5</b> different undergraduate faculties at UBC.</p>
							<h2>5 PAIN POINTS</h2>
							<ol>
								<p>
								<li><b>Limited to-do list:</b> only showed tasks for upcoming week.</li>
								<li><b>Unclear use for calendar:</b> not only did most students note that they did not even notice the calendar existed, but those who were aware of it found no use for it, as it did not sync daily events/tasks with the to-do list, and the calendar would be left empty as a result.</li>
								<li><b>Unintuitive icons:</b> crowded the interface and students had difficulty understanding their meanings.</li>
								<li><b>Indirect syllabus button:</b> location of syllabus button was inconsistent between course pages and took multiple steps in order to be reached.</li>
								<li><b>Inconsistent email format:</b> unfamiliar email layout required user to learn how to navigate email differently from how they would navigate their typical mail app, while also lacking functions such as viewing sent messages.</li>
								</p>
							</ol>

							<h2>DESIGN EXPLORATION</h2>
								<p>Based on the results from our usability tests, we organized our ideas to begin creating our user flows and prototypes.</p>
								<div class="content">
									<img src="images/canvas_wireframe.jpg" alt="canvas_wireframe" style="width:100%"/>
								</div>
							<h2>CONSTRAINTS</h2>
								<ul>
									<p>	
										<li>Small sample size: results are not completely generalizable to entire UBC population.</li>
										<li>The design should not change so much that it becomes unintuitive or unnecessarily changes user flows.</li>
										<li>This redesign is catered towards the function of the Canvas app for students, further research could include potential improvements to usability for professors.</li>
									</p>
								</ul>
							<h2>SOLUTIONS</h2>
							<ul>
								<p>
								<li>Updated to-do list to display all upcoming events in chronological order, with option to view events for all courses or for one course at a time.</li>
								<li>Created calendar that syncs with to-do list, including function to double-tap any date to view to-do list for that day (this also allows users to more easily view tasks for dates that are further away).</li>
								<li>Simplified icons where they added to the function of the page and removed icons that only crowded the page.</li>
								<li>Created a consistent layout for course page with button that goes directly to syllabus PDF.</li>
								<li>Updated email format to become more familiar/intuitive for the user and created option to view emails for all courses or a specific course.</li>
								</p>
							</ul>
							<div class="content">
								<img src="images/canvas_solutions.png" alt="canvas_solutions" style="width:100%"/>
							</div>
							<h3>ADDITIONAL POINTS:</h3>
								<ul>
								<p>
									<li>3D aspects changed to flatlay and corners of content boxes were rounded to modernize Canvas' user interface.</li>
									<li>'Group' button was removed to simply interface of home page and prevent crowding - majority of students did not have this button, and those who did found no use from it.</li>
									<li>Colours for each course on the home page were made to remain consistent through their corresponding to-do tasks and individual course pages.</li>
								</p>
								</ul>	
							<h2>TAKEAWAYS & CRITIQUES</h2>
								<p>While the main goal of this project was to improve the usability and overall function of the Canvas app, many changes were made to the colour scheme as well. It was taken into account that making too many changes can also lead to a confusing user experience, and so we were careful to avoid unnecessary changes to user flows and the general app structure. <br><br>
									Previously, the Canvas app would match its colour scheme to that of the user’s school, meaning the app would look different to each student based on the logo colours of the school they attend. For example, the University of British Columbia’s Canvas app uses navy blue and white, while the University of Washington’s Canvas app uses purple and beige. <br>
									This takes away from consistency between users and attractiveness of the app. For example, this could be potentially confusing to a transfer student, and also cause the overall interface to look less attractive, as the resulting colour combinations will not always be harmonious. The proposed solution was to create a universal colour scheme for Canvas that made it appear fun and appealing to the user.
