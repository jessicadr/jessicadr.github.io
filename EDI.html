				<h2>Project details</h2>
				<p><b>Product:</b> EDI Website (<a href="https://apsc.ubc.ca/EDI"
						target=_blank>https://apsc.ubc.ca/EDI</a>) <br>
					<b>Role:</b> UX/UI Designer<br>
					<b>Tools:</b> Figma<br>
					<b>Timeline:</b> 2 months<br>
					<b>Team:</b> Reginald Sacdalan, Rob Driscoll, Tony Wu, Ailish Stratham, Dana-Lyn Mackenzie, Sheryl
					Staub-French, Jessica del Rosario</p>
				<h2>Building a respectful and inclusive community</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this project was to design a website that creates a relationship of trust and
					inclusivity within the UBC Faculty of Applied Science (APSC). We wanted to support diversity within
					our community by providing examples of our initiatives to embed equity into our curriculum, along
					with resources for our faculty, staff and students to learn more about Equity, Diversity & Inclusion
					(EDI) principles.


					<h2>Research</h2>
					<p>I communicated with the website stakeholders to define the copy content
						for this website. They originally provided a list of what content to include on the website, and
						I continued to iterate upon this with the stakeholders to ensure that the text was digestible
						for users, while still conveying a message that aligned with our values.</p>
					<p>I also did a comparative analysis with other EDI websites, mostly from other universities. I
						took note of the components that we might be able to use in our design based on our current
						branding and design system, as well as content that we might want to add, such as spotlight
						features for EDI events/initiatives.
					</p><br>

					<h2>Design</h2>
					<p>I started with low-fidelity sketches to propose ideas for the page layout, allowing for quick
						iteration and efficient communication of my design proposals. After finalizing the layout with
						the stakeholders based on the content hierarchy and user personas developed, I began creating
						mid-fidelity mockups.
					</p>
					<p>I was also in constant communication with our developers, asking them about the feasibility for
						any newly proposed components or functionalities - this allowed me to revise my designs step by
						step, and avoid having to make large adjustments that could delay the project.</p>
					<p>Past iterations:</p><br>
					<span class="image"><img class="canvasimg1" src="images/EDI-iterations-all.jpg" alt="EDI iterations"
							width="75%" /></span><br>
					<p>After finalizing the mid-fidelity mockups, I moved onto designing high-fidelity mockups, applying
						branding and components from our design system (<a
							href="http://apsc-designsystem.sites.olt.ubc.ca/"
							target=_blank>http://apsc-designsystem.sites.olt.ubc.ca/</a>), which
						I also lead the design for. I also added the new components we created for this project,
						such as the slider on each key value page which provides examples of UBC APSC’s initiatives.
					</p>
					<p>As always, I kept mobile in mind when designing each page, and created each design for both
						mobile and desktop interfaces to ensure that they were scalable.

					<h2>Chalenges & limitations</h2>
					<p>UBC APSC has a common look and feel that was predetermined before this website and our design
						system were created. This inherently put certain limitations on what we could do with the
						design, but also helped me learn how to both redesign and create new designs by working with
						what we have, and making improvements where we are able to do so.
					</p>
					<p>We were also conducting multiple projects, such as the redesign of our entire main online
						platform (<a href="https://apsc.ubc.ca/" target=_blank>https://apsc.ubc.ca/</a>) during this
						time, so our
						small team of developers and myself, as the only designer, were limited for time. We didn’t get
						enough time to test the site with users as we were focused on other areas of our main project,
						but
						this helped
						me understand the importance of communicating with both developers and site stakeholders
						constantly - I allowed the stakeholders to freely comment on Figma whenever they had an idea or
						suggestions, and this really helped move the design forward despite us having to work remotely.
					</p>
