				<h2>Project details</h2>
				<p><b>Team:</b> Reginald Sacdalan - Web & Digital Communications Manager, Tony Wu - Developer, Lua
					Presidio - Digital Marketing Assistant, Jessica del Rosario - UX/UI Designer & Project Manager<br>
					<b>Role:</b> UX/UI Designer, Illustrator, Project Manager<br>
					<b>Tools:</b> Figma, Qualtrics surveys, Jira<br>
					<b>Timeframe:</b> 2 months</p>
				<p><b>Product:</b> <a href="http://apsc-designsystem.sites.olt.ubc.ca/" target=_blank>Atom - UBC APSC design system</a> (implementation still in progress)</p>

				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>Atom, UBC Applied Science’s design system, is a visual language that provides guidelines for UX, UI
					and development, ensuring that products are both accessible and intuitive. This design system helps
					cross-functional teams collaborate to create an engaging experience for the APSC audience.
					The name ‘Atom’ represents how our design system contains the basic building blocks needed to create
					our websites, similar to how atoms are the necessary building blocks required to create all matter.
					This concept also stemmed from the Atomic Design Method. (<a
						href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/" target=_blank>Source</a>)</p>

				<h2>Project goal</h2>
				<p>Our goal was to create a central resource of pattern libraries and style guides that can be used to
					ensure all UBC APSC products are scalable and accessible. This design system was also meant to help
					designers and developers collaborate in the future, improving our overall team workflow, while still
					maintaining the common look and feel of UBC APSC’s brand.</p>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				<p>In contrast to my previous projects, much of my research for the design system involved looking at
					the architecture of other design systems such as Polaris from Shopify, Primer from Github, Material
					from Google, and Atlassian. Based on the content in the pattern libraries and style guides I saw, I
					began to take inventory of what UBC Applied Science already had and what was missing. I organized
					these elements into groups through a card sorting process as this would later help in defining our
					information architecture.</p><br>
				<span class="image"><img class="canvasimg1" src="images/Atom-landing-page.png"
						alt="Landing page" /></span><br><br>
				<p>I also tested the accessibility of the design systems mentioned previously and took inspiration from
					the strongest aspects of each to build Atom. In doing so, I refreshed my knowledge on the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target=_blank>WCAG 2.0</a> to ensure that all elements of
					our design system aligned with accessibility guidelines, which helped me to write out the Design
					Principles section of Atom as well as guidelines for future designers on our Confluence
					page.<br><br>
					Here’s a surface-level look into the iterative process that we took to design our web layout: </p>
				<br>
				<span class="image"><img class="canvasimg1" src="images/Atom-web-layout-iterations.png"
						alt="Web layout" /></span>


				<h2>Design</h2>
				<p>I communicated with our developers, Web and Digital Communications coordinators, marketing
					coordinators and more to ensure that our design system encompassed the needs and values of UBC
					Applied Science. I familiarized myself with our current online platform, and made suggestions for
					improvement based on what I observed in terms of both appearance and usability.</p>
				<p>I aimed to make Atom as intuitive and accessible as possible, since I wanted to prioritize ensuring
					that any APSC faculty or audience member could use it with ease.</p><br>
				<span class="image"><img class="canvasimg1" src="images/Atom-Design.png" alt="Design" /></span><br>
				<p>I also created illustrations following the brand guidelines for our design system, adding a visual
					element to text-heavy pages in order to make them easier to digest while also keeping the user's
					attention.</p>
				<span class="image"><img class="canvasimg1" src="images/design-principles-illustration.png"
						alt="Design principles illustration" /></span><br>
				<p>Another important part of this design system was the scaleable component and style library I created
					in Figma (still in progress, as we are still continuing to update the design of our website). This
					library holds all of our design system styles and components, allowing us us to maintain consistent
					typography, color scheme, components, spacing, and more across all of our design files. I designed
					each component to be scalable for both mobile, desktop, and tablet views.</p>

				<h2>Challenges + What I learned from them</h2>
				<p>A challenge I faced here was learning how to manage a project for the first time. With no previous
					experience leading a project, I learned both through independent research and by improving on my
					past mistakes. As both a project leader and designer, I learned how to communicate between roles
					effectively and create a simple yet effective way of transitioning from the design to development
					stage.</p>
				<p>
					Another big challenge I faced was maintaining the APSC branding while still making tweaks to it at
					the same time, to create a pattern library with the finalized components. The fact that we were
					undergoing a rebranding while creating the design system made this project a bit more complicated,
					so efficient communication and organized workflow were crucial. I learned the importance of tracking
					individual tasks from the beginning of the research process, all throughout the design and
					development process, as many components would go through multiple iterations at different paces
					before becoming finalized. Tracking the individual progress of each task allowed us to see what
					needed to be reviewed, what was in progress, and what was ready to be published.
