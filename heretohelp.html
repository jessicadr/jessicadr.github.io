							<h2>PROJECT DETAILS</h2>
							<p><b>Tools:</b> Figma, Adobe XD<br>
								<b>Timeframe:</b> 10 days (Mar 5-15)<br>
								<b>Product:</b> Mobile app, <a href="WishDesignChallenge_SlideDeck.pdf" target="_blank">Slide deck</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/522207431" target="_blank">Prototype click-through</a></p>

								
							<h2>PROJECT BACKGROUND + GOAL</h2>
								<p>This project was for the Wish Design Challenge. The prompt was to choose an existing organization and help them design a mobile experience that allows an individual to tackle a major problem afflicting society today.
									I created a mobile experience for <a href="https://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/" target="_blank">HereToHelp</a>, to make mental health guidance more accessible and intuitive for users. 
									Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when seeking guidance in-person poses a risk to one’s physical health, the mental health resources on HereToHelp could be useful for individuals who would like to learn more about their mental health, or how to support others.
									
								</p>

							<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
							
							<h3>Company background</h3>
								<p>HereToHelp is a project of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Substance Use Information, created by a team of seven leading mental health and substance non-profit agencies. Their goal is to help people in BC manage their mental health by providing resources & concrete steps towards better understanding mental health.</p>
							
							<h3>The problem</h3>
								<p>Many individuals experience mental illness, yet do not seek help or will wait until the condition becomes severe or even life-threatening because they do not know where to seek guidance.
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img class="centerimguxlab" src="images/heretohelp/Heretohelp_ProblemStat.png" alt="Problem stat" width=50% /></span>
							
							<h3>Perception test</h3>
								<p>Users got 8-10 minutes to freely explore the HereToHelp website and verbalize their thoughts.
								The perception test results helped me better understand the existing services of the HereToHelp website and its potential strengths/weaknesses. This also allowed me to discover what I might want to tweak or add in the app.</p>
						
							<h3>Scenario test</h3>
								<p>I asked users to take a screening self-test on the website and verbalize their thoughts during the process. Based on the background research, screening self-tests were an important existing function of the website. The user feedback on these tests allowed me to define any pain points or potential areas for improvement.
									<br>*Note: A screening self-test is a short, anonymous self-test that helps users discover their likelihood of having a mental illness or symptoms, before deciding to seek a mental health professional. 
								</p>
							
							<h3>Top feedback</h3>
								<p>The top user feedback I gathered from the perception and scenario tests:</p>
							
								<h4>Pros</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Self-test is useful for learning about symptoms & how to get help</li>
									<li>Can learn how to support yourself and others</li>
									<li>Lots of reliable info on various mental health topics</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Cons</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>There is no way to track progress in the self-test</li>
									<li>Light font colours are difficult to read on white background</li>
									<li>Too much scrolling/ searching required to find self-tests</li>
								</ul>

							<h3>User survey</h3>
							<p>I did a survey to narrow down the main pain points that target users may face when seeking mental health support. 
								This feedback also helped me define the main functions for the app.</p>
								<h4>Goals</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Understand the users’ needs when they are seeking mental health guidance</li>
									<li>Determine users’ frustrations when seeking mental health guidance</li>
									<li>Identify functions users might expect to see on an app that provides mental health guidance</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Participants</h4>
								<ul>
									<li><b># of Responses:</b> 40</li>
									<li><b>Age:</b> 18-35</li>
									<li><b>Location:</b> British Columbia (HereToHelp's target audience)</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Results</h4>
								<span class="image"><img class="centerimguxlab" src="images/heretohelp/Heretohelp_UserSurveyStat.png" alt="Survey stat" width=50% /></span>
								
							<h3>3 Key Pain Points</h3>
							<p>I identified 3 key pain points that users experience when seeking mental health guidance, based on the user tests and survey.</p>
								<h4>1. Inconvenience</h4>
								<p>Users avoid seeking help for mental illness due to inconvenience - they don’t have enough time, it’s too much hassle, or it's too expensive.</p>
								<h4>2. Lack of Resources</h4>
								<p>Users avoid seeking help due to lack of accessibility to  resources - they don’t know where to look/who to ask for help.</p>
								<h4>3. Lack of Support Knowledge</h4>
								<p>Users want to support others they care about who are experiencing mental health problems but are unsure how.</p>
							

							<h2>Ideation & Testing</h2>
							<h3>User personas</h3>
							<span class="image"><img class="centerimguxlab" src="images/heretohelp/Heretohelp_UserPersonas.png" alt="User personas" width=75% /></span>
							
							<h3>3 Main solutions</h3>
							<p>I identified 3 main solutions to include in the mobile app, based on the 3 key pain points identified from the user research.</p>
								<h4>1. Mental health screening self-tests</h4>
								<p>Short, anonymous, free self-tests for mental health that help users discover their likelihood of having a mental illness before seeing a doctor.
									The results also provide a list of symptoms that can helpful for users who are nervous about what to say during an appointment. This was also 
									an existing function of the HereToHelp website.
								</p>
								<h4>2. Resources</h4>
								<p>Information and links to support lines, referral services, support groups, and more. Multiple resources on one page targeted towards providing mental health support to users in British Columbia could
									help individuals find nearby guidance in their area more easily (e.g. contact info for mental health organizations so users can easily contact them without having to search for each organization's info on their own).
										</p>
								<h4>3. Education on how to support others</h4>
								<p>An organized page providing education on how to help others experiencing a mental illness, which could
									help users learn how they can provide support for those they care about.
									HereToHelp already had a variety of reliable info on their website on how to support those you care about.
										</p>

								<h3>Low-fidelity user flows</h3>
								<p>I created a user flow map based on the personas and target functions I defined.</p>
								<span class="image"><img class="centerimguxlab" src="images/heretohelp/HeretoHelp_Lofi_Userflow.jpg" alt="Low-fidelity user flow" width=75% /></span>

								<h3>Mid-fidelity user flows</h3>
								<p>I created mid-fidelity designs, also accounting for the user feedback I got from the surveys and tests (e.g. added progress bar to the self-test so users can see how far into the test they are).</p>
								<span class="image"><img class="centerimguxlab" src="images/heretohelp/Heretohelp_Midfi_Userflow.jpg" alt="Mid-fidelity user flow" width=75% /></span>
										<h4>Mid-fidelity usability testing</h4>
										<p>Before creating high-fidelity designs, I did a usability test on my mid-fidelity designs to validate my initial ideas and get user feedback, making iterations where needed. I asked 5 participants to perform two tasks:
											<ul>
												<li>Find & complete a self-screening test</li>
												<li>Find a link to a support resource</li>
											</ul>
										</p>

								<h2>Prototyping</h2>
								<h3>High-fidelity designs</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Added color and branding to the app based on the website UI</li>
										<li>Based on user feedback, tweaked colors to improve accessibility & meet contrast requirements</li>
										<li>Added certain UI elements to give a more approachable look and feel (e.g. clouds in header)</li>
									</ul>
									<span class="image"><img class="centerimguxlab" src="images/heretohelp/Heretohelp_High_Fidelity.jpg" alt="High-fidelity designs" width=75% /></span>

								<h3>Prototype demo</h3>
								<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/522207431" target="_blank">Prototype click-through:</a> A video demo of the main user flows for the 
								HereToHelp mobile app (note: the screening self-test is shortened for the purpose of the demo).</p>

									</div>

								<h2>Reflection</h2>
								<h3>What I learned</h3>
								<h4>Given time, do a competitive analysis</h4>
								<p>There are many apps targeted towards mental health support in the market.
										Competitive analysis could allow me to define functions that existing apps have/lack, 
										while also identifying their strengths/ weaknesses and potentially improving my design.
										</p>
								<h3>Future steps</h3>
								<h4>Expand to other provinces</h4>
								<p>Expand services to other provinces in Canada. Give users the option to indicate their location at the beginning of the experience so that their results are catered to resources that are nearby.
										</p>
								<h4>More usability testing</h4>
								<p>Test high-fidelity designs for accessibility and usability, and implement feedback from tests into further design iterations.
